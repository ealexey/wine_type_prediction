# wine_type_prediction


The aim of this project is to predict type of the wine-white or red-based on its chemical properties. For this project two wine datasets were used that contain information about some chemical components for both the white wine and the red wine. The two analyzed datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Vinho Verde (pronounced “veeng-yo vaird”) is a Portuguese wine that comes from the region of Vinho Verde. The 11 chemical component concentrations were included in datasets together with a column containing quality score of each wine (score ranges between 0 and 10). Each dataset contains following features:

1 - fixed acidity 

2 - volatile acidity 

3 - citric acid 

4 - residual sugar 

5 - chlorides 

6 - free sulfur dioxide 

7 - total sulfur dioxide 

8 - density 

9 - pH 

10 - sulphates 

11 - alcohol 

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)


Logistic regression was used to classify a wine for white or red based on its chemical components.

 
The accuracy, precision, and recall of the model is pretty high around 0.99
